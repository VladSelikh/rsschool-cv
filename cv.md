## My Story<br/>
My main goal is to become a high-qualified Front-End Developer and Technical Specialist.<br/>
Education in the university game me some basics of economics, math and computer science. So my first job as **marketing analyst in TEZ Tour Ltd.** was directly connected to _math and economics_.<br/>
**My main duties includeed**:
* agency's support for arising booking questions (only at the very beginning - first 4-5 months);
* collecting the marketing data regarding competitors' special offers, commission programs, discount for tourists and so on;
* comparision of prices for touristic services between the company and competiotors, composing the results using MS Excel Tool and sending it to the manager for him/her to make operational decisions on this basis;
* comparision of prices for accomadation of this year to the previous one to indicate the possible gap that could cause demand decline.<br>
After 2 years in this position I realized that my current job did not contributed to my growth as a professional because of continuously repeating tasks and (what is _more important_) to improving my English.<br/>
So with great interest to programming and web development and great desire to learn more I desided to pave my way in the world of Frond-End Development.<br/>
Among my strengths that help in my aspirations are:
1. Great responsibility and self-organization
1. Ability to work with multiple tasts
1. Good comunication skills
1. Very calm, but at the same time precise character<br/>
