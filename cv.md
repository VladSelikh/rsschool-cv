## My Story

My main goal is to become a high-qualified Front-End Developer and Technical Specialist.
Education in the university gave me some basics of economics, math and computer science. So my first job as **marketing analyst in TEZ Tour Ltd.** was directly connected to _math and economics_.
But after that I decided implement and expand my knowledge and become an IT specialist, and specifically - QA Automation Engineer with JavaScript / Typescript technological stack. After successfully grading the courses in **EPAM Systems** I brought this idea to life.
And I realize that it is about time to grow in other sphere and become "T-shaped" specialist.

## My main duties include

- writing web automation tests with Playwright test automation tool on TypeScript
- writing tests automation scripts for mobile applications with WebdriverIO/Appium test automation tool on TypeScript
- running regression tests with the usage of CircleCI tools
- new functionality manual testing
- writing manual testing documentation: test cases, bug reports, using Linear bug tracking system
- support of the existing tests
- participation in scrum ceremonies: daily stand-up, sprint planning, backlog refinement
