## My Story

My main goal is to become a high-qualified Front-End Developer and Technical Specialist.
Education in the university gave me some basics of economics, math and computer science. So my first job as **marketing analyst in TEZ Tour Ltd.** was directly connected to _math and economics_.
But after that I decided implement and expand my knowledge and become an IT specialist, and specifically - QA Automation Engineer with JavaScript / Typescript technological stack. After successfully grading the courses in **EPAM Systems** I brought this idea to life.
And I realize that it is about time to grow in other sphere and become "T-shaped" specialist.

## My main duties include

- writing web automation tests with Playwright test automation tool on TypeScript
- writing tests automation scripts for mobile applications with WebdriverIO/Appium test automation tool on TypeScript
- running regression tests with the usage of CircleCI tools
- new functionality manual testing
- writing manual testing documentation: test cases, bug reports, using Linear bug tracking system
- support of the existing tests
- participation in scrum ceremonies: daily stand-up, sprint planning, backlog refinement

## My strengths

1. Great responsibility and self-organization
2. Ability to work with multiple tasks
3. Good communication skills
4. Very calm, but at the same time precise character

## Key Skills

- UI and API testing (Advanced)
- JavaScript / TypeScript (Advanced)
- WebdriverIO(Advanced)
- Cypress (Advanced)
- Playwright (Advanced)
- Jenkins (Advanced)

## Code Examples (JS)

```javascript
function pow() {
  const a = prompt("Enter number x...");
  const x = +a;
  const b = prompt("Enter number n...");
  const n = +b;
  if (a === null || b === null || isNaN(x) || isNaN(n)) {
    confirm("You have entered invalid parameters!");
  } else if (n < 0 || n % 1 !== 0) {
    confirm("n parameter should be positive number upper 0!");
  } else {
    alert(x ** n);
  }
}

pow();
```
